        <h2>Apollo 11 Moon Landing</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Apollo 11 was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on
            the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz
            Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at
            20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the
            Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56
            UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two
            and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named
            Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5
            pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot
            Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and
            were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting
            off to rejoin Columbia.

          Michael Collins on 50th Anniversary Of The Moon Landing
        </h2>

          <p class="article1-para1">
            Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins Narrated A Google Doodle For The
            50th Anniversary Of The Apollo 11 Moon Landing, describing the
            Apollo 11 launch, the journey to the Moon, the tense descent to the
            lunar surface, and his own experience drinking coffee on the far
            side of the Moon.. "Behind the Moon, I was by myself -- all alone
            but not lonesome," said Collins. "I felt very comfortable back
            there; I even had hot coffee."
          </p>
          <p class="article1-para2">
            "The first time we saw the Moon up close, it was a magnificint
            spectacle. It was huge. The Sun was coming around it, cascading and
            making a golden halo, and it filled our entire window," said
            Collins. But although they were looking out the spacecraft window at
            a whole rocky world where no human had ever set foot, the Apollo 11
            crew were more amazed by the sight of their distant homeworld. "It
            was nothing compared to the sight of the tiny Earth. The Earth was
            the main show. The Earth was it," said Collins.
